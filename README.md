# NexusLink Sales Performance Report

## Background

The following data is from a company called NexusLink that specializes in selling computer hardware to various different enterprises. The purpose of this report was to analyze the data on their sales team, their product offerings, and their clientele to provide insights and recommendations for their upcoming year. Since this was NexusLink's first year, there is no prior data. I also created a dashboard for stakeholders to explore the data.

The dashboard can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/575XDNSNM?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of our sales performance, identifying key strengths, areas for improvement, and strategic recommendations. Darcel Schlecth is our top-performing salesperson, significantly surpassing others in closed deal value with an efficient closing time of 49.3 days. However, Violet Mclelland and Willburn Farren are underperforming, requiring intervention for performance improvement. Moses Frase and Lajuana Vencil take the longest to close deals, suggesting a need for process optimization.

Among managers, Rocco Neubert leads the strongest team, with three of the top five salespeople under his management. Cara Losch and Dustin Brinkmann's teams generate the least revenue amongst managers. In terms of client engagement, KanCode is our most valuable account and Acme Corporation is our most valuable company whose subsidiaries account for $519,349 of our revenue. Retail and Technology sectors generate the most revenue, while Services and Employment are the least valuable.

The GTX Pro is our best-selling product, and the MG Special is the least-selling product . The GTX Pro also has the shortest closing time at 45.735 days, while the GTX 500 takes the longest at 53.720 days. Peak sales occur in June, September, and December, suggesting potential seasonal trends. Strategic actions should include improving sales efficiency, capitalizing on top talent, optimizing product positioning, and expanding efforts in high-value sectors.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Enhance Support for Underperforming Salespeople**: Additional training, sales mentorship, or account reassignment may help Violet Mclelland and Willburn Farren improve their performance. Given Willburn Farren's expectionally high average close value, his performance may improve if provided with more leads.
  
2. **Reduce Closing Time for Long-Cycle Salespeople**: Implement coaching or process optimization for Moses Frase and Lajuana Vencil to accelerate their deal closures.
  
3. **Capitalize on Top Sales Talent**: Darcel Schlecth's efficiency and high close value indicate an opportunity to assign high-value or slow-closing accounts to them for improved conversion rates.
  
4. **Optimize Product Positioning**: Given the strong sales of GTX Pro, we should assess promotional strategies to boost similar product sales. Also focus on conducting product analysis to gain insights on MG Special's poor performance. 

5.  **Clientele Relations**: Maintain strong relationship with Acme Corporation and KanCode as they are our most valuable clients. And expand relationships with Condax and Conax as we enter the next year.
  
6. **Expand Engagement in Valuable Sectors**: Targeting the Retail and Technology industries further may yield additional growth opportunities, while refining our approach to Services and Employment sectors could uncover untapped potential.
  
7. **Refine Sales Management Strategies**: Consider placing Cara Losch and Dustin Brinkmann on performance improvement plans to potentially increase their performance and also consider workforce realignment strategies and exploring alternate staffing solutions.
